## **Typescript**
- Superset of JS.
- Not like having additional features to JS.
- Write code in precise manner to avoid less errors in runtime.
- All about `type safety`, nothing else.
- Layer to JS. A development tool.
    - Runs the project 100% JS.
    - Just a wrapper to JS.
    - Not a standalone language.
- **Typescript does**:
    - **Static Checking**
        - the parser or entire syntax is constantly analyzed by the IDEs.
        - Not in the case of JS.
        - Analyze the code as we type.
